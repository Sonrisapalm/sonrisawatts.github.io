                    <p>The <strong>Emotion Encoded</strong> initiative is a continuous, mixed-methods research study designed to explore public and professional perceptions of AI. This research combines quantitative and qualitative data collection to provide a comprehensive understanding of emotional reasoning, biases, and ethical considerations in AI adoption. These methods ensure that findings accurately reflect both professional and public perspectives, enabling evidence-based recommendations for AI integration in high-stakes fields.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Quantitative Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>Quantitative data is collected through a series of structured surveys distributed to over <strong>100</strong> respondents. The primary data collection instrument is <strong>Google Forms</strong>, featuring a mix of open-ended, multiple-choice, and Likert scale questions. Surveys are disseminated via social networks and in-person outreach to ensure a broad and diverse sample.</p>
                    <p>To date, two key surveys have been completed, with ongoing monthly data collection for a longitudinal design:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-text-light">
                        <li><strong>Survey 1:</strong> n≈69 respondents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Survey 2:</strong> n≈44 respondents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ongoing surveys:</strong> Monthly collection to track evolving perceptions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Qualitative Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>Qualitative insights are gathered through <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with over <strong>12</strong> professionals and subject-matter experts. Interviews are conducted via written responses and phone calls, allowing for flexible and detailed conversations. Participants include professionals such as Dr. Bichara Sahely (physician) and Alex Straun (finance).</p>
                    <p>Qualitative interview data undergoes <strong>thematic</strong> and <strong>semantic analysis</strong>. Transcripts are systematically coded to identify recurring ideas, sentiments, and patterns. Emergent themes are synthesized into research findings, which inform articles, policy recommendations, and public discussions.</p>
