      <h1>About Emotion Encoded</h1>
      <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Sonrisa Watts</strong>, 24 years old from the beautiful island of St. Kitts and Nevis. I founded <strong>Emotion Encoded</strong> in June 2025 to investigate AI integration and adoption through the lenses of <strong>cognitive bias, psychological resistance, and emotional reasoning</strong>.</p>

        <div class="diary-body">
          <p>Sonrisa was born on December 13th, 2000, in St. Kitts and Nevis. Growing up in <strong>Conaree</strong>, her early years were defined by a family that poured everything they had into her growth.</p>
          
          <p>Her father, a teacher and skill trainer, was a constant presence from her childhood through her teens. She still relies on the lessons from their long beach walks and morning meditations. He taught her how to treat people, the importance of exercise, and how to stay involved in the world around her. Her mother was just as invested, ensuring Sonrisa had the space to find her own identity through piano, dance, and modeling. Both parents simply wanted the best for her.</p>

          <p>However, when Sonrisa was around 12 or 13, her world began to shift when her parents divorced. It was a difficult transition that required a strength she didn't know she had yet.. though, looking back, it was only the beginning of what "life" had in store.</p>

          <p>Fast forward to 2025. At 24 years old, on Christmas Day, Sonrisa faced a deeply traumatic and violent experience while walking through town to go home. In the aftermath, she felt she couldn't open up to anyone. She was left with two choices: let the weight of the trauma pull her into depression, or find a way to move through the pain.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            She chose the latter. To distract herself and begin the process of healing, she threw herself into research. She chose to keep her mind busy and her spirit focused. That decision to turn internal pain into external action was the real start of her independent work.
