    <h1>About Emotion Encoded</h1>
    <p>
      Emotion Encoded is a research and dialogue platform exploring how emotional reasoning, 
      cultural context, and psychological bias shape human trust in AI systems. Our mission is 
      to bridge the gap between emerging technology and human understanding, ensuring that AI 
      tools are transparent, ethical, and inclusive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Founded at the intersection of psychology and technology, Emotion Encoded collaborates with 
      professionals in high-stakes industries such as law, healthcare, and finance to investigate 
      how trust is built—or broken—in AI adoption. Through interviews, public engagement, and 
      experimental research, we aim to create actionable frameworks for AI governance and trust-building.
    </p>

    <p>
      This initiative is led by researcher Sonrisa Watts with a background in psychology, who is now breaking into AI 
      ethics, trust, and human-computer interaction. Our work is part of a broader vision to 
      equip governments, professionals in high-stake fields, organizations, and communities with the insights needed to navigate 
      an AI-driven future responsibly.
