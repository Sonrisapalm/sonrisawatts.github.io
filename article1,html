  <h1>AI Therapist vs AI Financial Advisor: Who Do You Trust More?</h1>
  <img src="images/article1.jpg" alt="Research in Caribbean Region">
  <p>
    I conducted research in the Caribbean Region and got some interesting answers. Most responses are from St. Kitts & Nevis.
    I asked: "Who would you trust more: An AI Advisor or an AI Therapist?"
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial advisor is a little too private for me</li>
    <li>I prefer a human to deal with my money</li>
    <li>Therapist errors are less likely to be lethal</li>
    <li>Although both should be private, an AI therapist can draw on a large resource and apply it to challenges I may be experiencing whereas finances are more personal.</li>
    <li>Therapist work may involve actual human feelings and rational thinking, while financial advice is based on numbers and their interpretation.</li>
    <li>A therapist needs a certain level of emotional intelligence that AI has not developed.</li>
    <li>Finance is numbers. I can sort out my own feelings.</li>
    <li>Therapist has a lot more nuances and human components that robots can’t completely understand.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    What does this mean?<br>
    Trust isn't automatic.<br>
    Have we considered all the risks involved with trusting an AI tool with our finances or personal feelings?<br>
    Join the discussion and share your thoughts.
