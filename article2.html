      <p>
        Emotion Encoded asked participants "Would you take advice from an AI if it knew your entire personality and history?"<br/>
        Majority of people said "Maybe".<br/>
        15.6% said "No, that's creepy."

        This suggests that people are placing a limit on the amount and type of data that AI would have about them. Imagine an AI bot that knows information about you that you've never known yourself or information that is sacred to you and your family.

        Some people are completely against the idea of trusting artificial intelligence. In fact, many people admit that they could never adapt to a new reality centered around advanced technology. Not even transparency can change their minds. Status quo bias, maybe?
      </p>

      <p>
        Status quo bias is the tendency to prefer existing norms, processes, or decisions, even when there are better alternatives. Some people don't want better choices—they prefer outdated, traditional practices and ways of life.
