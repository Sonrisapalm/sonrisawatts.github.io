    <p>
      Emotion Encoded asked "What would you need to know about an AI tool in order to trust it?"<br><br>
      Some of the responses that the majority of participants chose were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Details about how the system was developed</li>
      <li>Information about how my personal data is stored and used</li>
      <li>Information about the data it was trained on</li>
      <li>Whether it has been tested for bias</li>
      <li>How often it makes mistakes</li>
      <li>Whether a human was involved in reviewing and approving its output</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What can we understand from this?<br>
      These insights show that trust in AI must be earned through transparency, ethical safeguards, and clear communication.<br>
      Many companies safeguard their intentions with person's data, as well as the details about their AI development.<br>
      As AI continues to transform industries, we must build systems that not only deliver technical performance but also respect human values.
