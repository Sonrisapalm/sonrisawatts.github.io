      <h2>Trust in AI: What People Want to Know</h2>
      <img src="images/articlethree.jpg" alt="Trust in AI Survey" class="article-image" />

      <p>
        Emotion Encoded asked "What would you need to know about an AI tool in order to trust it?"
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Details about how the system was developed</li>
        <li>Information about how my personal data is stored and used</li>
        <li>Information about the data it was trained on</li>
        <li>Whether it has been tested for bias</li>
        <li>How often it makes mistakes</li>
        <li>Whether a human was involved in reviewing and approving its output</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These insights show that trust in AI must be earned through transparency, ethical safeguards, and clear communication.
        Many companies safeguard their intentions with a person’s data, as well as the details about their AI development.
        As AI continues to transform industries, we must build systems that not only deliver technical performance but also respect human values.
