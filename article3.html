  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Details about how the system was developed</li>
    <li>Information about how my personal data is stored and used</li>
    <li>Information about the data it was trained on</li>
    <li>Whether it has been tested for bias</li>
    <li>How often it makes mistakes</li>
    <li>Whether a human was involved in reviewing and approving its output</li>

  <p>
    These insights show that trust in AI must be earned through transparency, ethical safeguards, and clear communication.
    Many companies safeguard their intentions with a personâ€™s data, as well as the details about their AI development.
    As AI continues to transform industries, we must build systems that not only deliver technical performance but also respect human values.
