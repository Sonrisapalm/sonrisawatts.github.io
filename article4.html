      <p>
        As part of my research initiative Emotion Encoded, I asked participants a simple but important question:
        <br>“Would you be comfortable if your child’s teacher used AI to help with grading or lesson planning?”
      </p>

      <p>The responses depicted something powerful:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>53.7% said “yes” but only under conditions — parents want AI as an assistant, with teacher review on every decision.</li>
        <li>26% said “no” — expressing resistance and lack of trust in AI for formative education.</li>
        <li>11% said “yes” without conditions — seeing AI simply as a tool, not a threat.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Conditional trust signals a bigger message: AI integration in education requires understanding human emotional reasoning.
        Concepts like Status Quo Bias, Automation Bias, Algorithm Aversion, and Framing Effects may influence trust.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, this echoes a larger theme in Emotion Encoded: AI is not only about performance; it’s about how people emotionally negotiate trust with these systems.
