      <p>
        As part of my research initiative <strong>Emotion Encoded</strong>, I asked participants a simple but important question:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><em>“Would you be comfortable if your child’s teacher used AI to help with grading or lesson planning?”</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The responses depicted something powerful:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>53.7% said “yes,” but only under conditions.</strong>
          Parents were open to AI as long as it performs its task and the teacher reviews every assignment and decision.
          This suggests parents prefer AI as an <em>assistant</em> rather than a replacement—highlighting the value placed on human reasoning, rationale, and judgment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>26% said “no.”</strong>
          This group expressed resistance, showing a lack of trust in AI for something as rigorous and formative as their child’s education.
          One possible reason: a child’s education requires critical thinking and emotional intelligence—capacities many believe AI has not mastered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>11% said “yes” without conditions.</strong>
          For this group, AI was viewed as another helpful tool in the classroom.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Conditional trust for AI in the classroom signals a bigger message: for effective AI integration into educational systems, <strong>psychology matters</strong>.

      <h2>How Cognitive Biases Shape Parent Attitudes</h2>

      <h3>Status Quo Bias</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Definition:</em> A preference for current systems over change, even when change may be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Classroom example:</em> “We’ve always graded manually.” Parents may feel similarly about traditional school tools and processes.
      </p>

      <h3>Automation Bias</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Definition:</em> Over-trusting AI outputs while discounting human judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Risk to avoid:</em> Teachers blindly accepting AI-generated grades without scrutiny.
      </p>

      <h3>Algorithm Aversion</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Definition:</em> Rejecting AI advice even when it is statistically superior.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Possible link to the data:</em> The 26% who reject AI entirely may be driven by distrust of algorithmic decision-making in sensitive contexts like education.
      </p>

      <h3>Framing Effect</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Definition:</em> Acceptance changes depending on how an option is presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Insight from this study:</em> Parents tolerate “AI-assisted” grading but are more likely to reject “AI-automated” grading.
      </p>

      <p>
        This echoes a larger theme in my research initiative: AI is not simply about performance; it’s about how people emotionally negotiate
        <strong>trust</strong> with these systems.
