        <section class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-200">
            <p>
                As part of my research initiative **Emotion Encoded**, I asked participants a simple but important question:
                *“Would you be comfortable if your child’s teacher used AI to help with grading or lesson planning?”*
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold text-xl text-orange-200">
                The responses depicted something powerful:
            </p>

            <p class="bg-gray-700/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500">
                **53.7%** of parents said **“yes,” but only under certain conditions.** They were open to AI as long as it performed its tasks and the teacher reviewed every assignment and decision. This suggests that parents prefer AI as a **support tool** rather than a replacement. It reflects **automation bias**, where people are willing to rely on automated systems but still want human oversight. It also highlights the value parents place on human reasoning, judgment, and rationale in education.
            </p>

            <p class="bg-gray-700/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500">
                **26%** of parents said **“no.”** This group showed resistance, signaling a lack of trust in AI for something as critical as a child’s education. Their responses align with **algorithm aversion**, a tendency to distrust automated systems, and may also involve **status quo bias**, as many parents prefer the familiar approach of teacher-led grading and lesson planning.
            </p>

            <p class="bg-gray-700/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500">
                **11%** of parents said **“yes” without conditions.** For these participants, AI was seen simply as another tool in the classroom rather than a potential threat. Their acceptance may have been influenced by the **framing effect**, where presenting AI as an assistant rather than a replacement helped build trust.
            </p>

            <p>
                The **conditional trust** parents display in AI use within education points to a larger message: the successful integration of AI requires attention to **human psychology**, not just system performance. These findings emphasize a key theme in my research initiative: AI adoption is deeply tied to how people emotionally and cognitively negotiate trust with these systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conditional trust for AI in the classroom from parents signals a bigger message. For AI integration into educational systems, **psychology is important**.
            </p>

            <p class="italic text-yellow-300 font-medium">
                *Status quo Bias? Automation Bias vs. Algorithm Aversion? Or Framing Effect?*
                
            </p>

            <p>
                This echoes a larger theme in my research initiative: AI is not simply about performance; it’s about how people **emotionally negotiate trust** with these systems.
