      <h2>St. Kitts & Nevis! Who Do You Trust More? An AI Therapist or an AI Financial Advisor?</h2>

      <p>If AI can’t ‘understand’ emotions, why do we trust it with life-altering money decisions? My research suggests it’s not about capability—it’s about the perceived risk. This challenges assumptions in AI design.</p>

      <p>Our research initiative, <strong>Emotion Encoded</strong>, asked 66 participants in St. Kitts a simple question:</p>
      <blockquote>“Who would you trust more, an AI therapist or an AI financial advisor?”</blockquote>

      <p>The results revealed an interesting psychological division on how people view trust, emotions, and something as personal as their money.</p>

      <h3>🇰🇳 AI Therapist?</h3>
      <p>Many participants rejected this idea outright. They felt that therapy requires empathy, compassion, and emotional intelligence. They suggested that these are human connection qualities AI cannot replicate. One participant stated: <em>"Human psychology is too delicate. I don’t trust artificial agents.”</em></p>

      <h3>🇰🇳 AI Financial Advisor?</h3>
      <p>The responses seemed to be more favorable towards using artificial intelligence for financial advice. Participants noted that finance is “numbers-based, logical, and supported by research.” Unlike humans, AI was seen as less likely to carry bias or ulterior motives. Some said they would trust AI to budget and audit their business for long-term success, since it has “no reason to steal my money.”</p>

      <p>Still, resistance is at the forefront: <em>“AI is man-made. I don’t trust it.”</em></p>

      <p>This contrast highlights a key insight from Emotion Encoded’s study: People are more open to AI in impersonal, data-driven fields like finance, but deeply resist it in emotion-centered spaces like therapy.</p>

      <p>At <strong>Emotion Encoded</strong>, we use psychology to explore these emotional barriers to AI adoption.</p>
