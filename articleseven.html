        <p>
          What happens to trust when professionals rely on AI but don’t disclose it?  
          In a survey of <strong>68 people</strong>, Emotion Encoded asked:  
          <em>“If your lawyer relied on an AI tool in your case without informing you, how would that affect your trust?”</em>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>39.7%</strong> said they would be fine with it <em>only if</em> the lawyer still used their own judgment</li>
          <li><strong>22.1%</strong> felt uncomfortable with the lack of transparency</li>
          <li><strong>13.2%</strong> said they would feel angry or betrayed</li>
          <li><strong>11.8%</strong> weren’t surprised, assuming AI already operates behind the scenes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The strongest message is clear: <strong>Accuracy alone doesn’t build trust</strong>.  
          An AI tool can statistically be 99.9% correct in legal analysis, but for everyday people,
          <strong>transparency and human oversight</strong> are what truly matter.
        </p>

        <h2>Psychology Terms that Apply</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automation Bias:</strong> The opposite risk — blindly accepting AI outputs without questioning them.</li>
          <li><strong>Framing Effect:</strong> People respond differently depending on the wording.  
          “AI support for lawyers” feels safer than “AI decision-making.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Matters for Domain Professionals</h2>
        <p>
          In high-stakes fields like law, clients aren’t just seeking efficiency.  
          They want <strong>honesty, accountability, and reassurance</strong> that human reasoning is still central.  
          AI doesn’t erase the need for human judgment — it makes it more valuable.
