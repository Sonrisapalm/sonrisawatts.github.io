            <p><em>Full interview and deeper insights coming soon.</em></p>

            <p>Our ongoing dialogue with <strong>Dr. Izben C. Williams</strong>, Consultant Psychiatrist at Psychotherapy Associates and a distinguished figure in mental health and public service, offers a unique psychological perspective on artificial intelligence and the future of human decision-making. As we prepare for a second round of questioning to capture the full depth of his insights, this preview highlights some of his early reflections.</p>

            <p>With more than <strong>three decades of psychiatric experience</strong>, Dr. Williams brings a grounded, human-centered lens to the topic of AI. His career spans clinical practice, academic leadership, and diplomacy. He has served as <strong>Ambassador to the United States and Permanent Representative to the OAS</strong>, and he currently holds long-standing roles as <strong>Professor and Clinical Preceptor at Windsor University School of Medicine</strong> and <strong>President and CEO of The Ripple Institute SKN</strong>. His medical and public health training includes work at the <strong>University of Toronto, the University of the West Indies, and George Washington University</strong>.</p>

            <p>Given this multi-layered background, Dr. Williams approaches AI with both scientific awareness and humanistic caution. He challenges the widespread fear that AI poses an existential threat:</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-orange-400 pl-4 italic text-lg">
                “I do not believe that AI as we know it now offers a threat to mankind’s dominance of this world.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>For Dr. Williams, much of society’s anxiety arises not from the technology itself but from unfamiliarity.</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-orange-400 pl-4 italic text-lg">
                “I think most people are afraid of it because they have not immersed themselves in it. I am sure there will be good and bad uses, but human judgment must prevail. The brain is not going to change in a hurry. It is the most complex entity on Earth, and I do not think it will quickly do anything to eliminate itself.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>He emphasizes the enduring wisdom of the human mind, reminding us that our collective judgment will guide technological evolution.</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-orange-400 pl-4 italic text-lg">
                “I hope wisdom will guide us in the right direction. The future will see it for itself.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>In this early conversation, Dr. Williams also hinted at deeper themes that will unfold in the full interview:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Empathy as a defining marker</strong> in understanding and regulating human and AI interaction. Expanded insights will arrive soon.</li>
                <li><strong>The “God particle” and the limits of scientific understanding</strong>, referencing the tradition of great thinkers, including Isaac Newton, who acknowledge the point where scientific inquiry meets mystery.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These reflections set the stage for an expansive conversation on psychology, technology, and the philosophical boundaries of human knowledge.</p>

            <p class="font-bold">The full interview with Dr. Izben Williams is coming soon to <strong>Emotion Encoded</strong>. Stay tuned.</p>
