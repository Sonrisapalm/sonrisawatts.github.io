                <p>When people imagine the future of work, they often picture machines taking over tasks once reserved for humans. But which jobs do we think are most vulnerable?</p>
                <p>In a recent Emotion Encoded survey of 43 respondents, people shared which professions they believe AI could potentially replace. The results are both predictable and surprising.</p>

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Creativity is not safe anymore.</h3>
                <p>The single highest response was **graphic designers (72.1%)**, followed closely by **software developers (69.8%)** and **writers (62.8%)**. This suggests people no longer see creativity or technical skill as uniquely human. AI’s ability to generate art, design, code, and text is reshaping what creative work even means.</p>

                <h3>2. White-collar professions — AI is coming.</h3>
                <p>Roles such as **accountants (55.8%)**, **tutors (55.8%)**, and **paralegals (55.8%)** were also seen as replaceable. This reflects how AI is viewed as powerful enough to handle structured, repetitive, and knowledge-heavy work ranging from legal briefs to lesson plans.</p>

                <h3>3. The service sector will be affected.</h3>
                <p>**Cashiers (46.5%)**, **retail workers (46.5%)**, and **travel agents (37.2%)** ranked high. This matches real-world automation we already see in self-checkouts, booking sites, and customer service chatbots.</p>

                <h3>4. Skepticism remains around human-heavy fields.</h3>
                <p>**Photographers (25.6%)**, **artists (30.2%)**, and **movie producers (30.2%)** scored lower. Respondents may feel that emotional intuition, vision, and cultural taste are harder for AI to replicate.</p>

                <h3>5. Models (20.9%) were the least selected.</h3>
                <p>This shows a belief that physical presence and human representation, at least for now, cannot be entirely faked by machines.</p>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>What stands out is the psychological contradiction. People are most ready to accept that AI can replace fields built on **creativity** such as design, writing, and software. Yet they resist the idea of AI replacing roles with a heavy **human, cultural, or physical component** even if those jobs might be easier to automate in theory.</p>
                <p class="concluding-thought">The question, then, is not only what jobs AI can do, but which human qualities we are most willing to let go of.</p>
