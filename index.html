        <h3>Research in the Caribbean Region</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted research in the Caribbean Region and I got some interesting answers. Most responses are from my hometown St. Kitts & Nevis.
          I asked "Who would you trust more? An AI advisor or an AI Therapist?"
          Here are some results. I'll publish the others next week. What do you think?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Financial advisor is a little too private for me.</li>
          <li>Therapist errors are less likely to be lethal.</li>
          <li>I prefer a human to deal with my money.</li>
          <li>Although both should be private and confidential, an AI therapist can draw on a large resource and apply it to challenges I may be experiencing whereas finances are more personal.</li>
          <li>Therapist work may involve actual human feelings and rational thinking, while financial advice is based on the numbers and their interpretation, the numbers speak for themselves.</li>
          <li>A therapist needs a certain level of emotional intelligence that I don't think AI has developed.</li>
          <li>Finance is numbers. I can sort out my own feelings.</li>
          <li>Therapist has a lot more nuances and human components that robots can’t completely understand. Financial is about understanding markets, money movement, world economy..more facts, more objectives. Robot advice will be more adequate.</li>
          <li>There are layers to communication which AI may not tap into within the process of therapy.</li>
          <li>Might be easier to see if it is working for me or not.</li>
          <li>It's research and figures, no understanding of emotions involved.</li>
          <li>Health over Wealth.</li>
          <li>The therapist errors are more easily corrected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>What does this mean?</strong><br />
          Trust isn't automatic.<br />
          Have we considered all the risks involved with trusting an AI tool with our finances or our personal feelings?<br />
          Is it mainly about communicating ethically?<br />
          What does this mean for people in financial advising?<br />
          What does this mean for psychologists?<br />
          Join in on the discussion.
